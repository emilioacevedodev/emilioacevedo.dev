Hello, world. My name is Emilio, and I'm a Senior Software Engineer.

For the better part of two decades, my world has been one of databases, APIs, massive processes, CI/CD pipelines, and complex enterprise architectures. I've built robust, scalable, and mission-critical applications. It's been a rewarding career, one that has taught me the value of solid foundations and meticulous design.

But I'm missing something. All this time, I've only created things for others, so I inevitably felt that call, the next step that had to come at some point: the desire to build something completely different. Something visual, interactive, from scratch, and my own.

### The Itch to Create

I've always been fascinated by virtual worlds and complex simulations, but my professional path led me down the road of enterprise software. Although it has been rewarding, the desire to build something tangible, something you can *see* and *feel*, has always been a quiet hum in the background.

This blog is the public chronicle of that new journey. It's my commitment to stepping out of my comfort zone.

### The Mission: Embracing the Junior Mindset

I'm embarking on my most ambitious personal project to date: a large-scale, interactive 3D experience for the web. For now, I'll call it **"Project S"**.

My goal is not just to build it, but to document the entire process in public: the good, the bad, and the buggy. This means embracing the humility of being a beginner again. After 20 years of being the "expert" for backend problems, I'm now the student, facing the intimidating interface of Blender and the endless possibilities of Three.js.

### The Toolkit

My arsenal for this adventure will be a mix of the familiar and the completely new:

* **3D Modeling:** Starting from zero with **Blender**.
* **Real-time Rendering:** Bringing it to life in the browser with **Three.js**.
* **Frontend & Blog:** This very site, built from scratch with **Astro**.
* **Backend:** Leveraging my experience with **Node.js, TypeScript,** and modern cloud architecture.

### The Promise

So, what can you expect from this space?

This won't be a polished tutorial series. It will be an unfiltered log of a senior developer tackling a new domain. I'll share architectural decisions, frustrating bugs, performance optimizations, 'aha!' moments in Blender, and the raw code behind it all.

If you're a developer curious about 3D, a creative professional interested in the tech, or just someone who enjoys watching a complex project come to life, I'd love for you to join me.

Let's build something cool.
